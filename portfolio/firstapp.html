                        <h3> Overview</h3>
                        <p> This was our final project of this course, we were
                            working in a group of four to come up with a new 
                            social media app for F.I.R.S.T. Institute students. 
                            The goal of this project was to develop the 
                            main pages of the app, without delving too deep into 
                            the deeper individual pages of the site map. We 
                            were to follow F.I.R.S.T.'s brand guidelines in 
                            order to maintain brand consistency.

                        <h3>Requirments</h3>
                        <p>
                            Our group was responsible for designing 9 pages 
                            of an app. How we showed these in our designs are 
                            completely up to us and our group. This can be 
                            through links, buttons, icons, etc. These where the 
                            required pages.

                        <h3>Design Process</h3>
                        <p>
                            <b>User Research:</b> My part of the design Process
                            was to work on the sign in page and the home page,
                            i started researching inspirations for how 
                            home pages and sign in pages look, i gathered all my
                            all research and created a mood board, which helped
                            me come up with my low-fi wireframes.
                        </p>
                        <!-- <img src="images/sign-in and homepage.png" alt="">
                          -->
                          <h3>Wireframing</h3>
                          <p>
                              <b>Lo-Fi:</b> My lo-fi's were created from my 
                              research , this is what our hi-fi was based on.
                              <!-- add lowfi images here  -->
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            <b>MI-FI:</b> MY mid level wireframe was looking
                            like this after all my research and low-fi work 
                            we as a group decided on the app aesthetic which was
                            <b>"Neubrutalism"</b> because we wanted the app to 
                            have a early 2000 web but still sticking to the 
                            clents colors so this was our wireframe.
                        </p>
                       
                        <div id="wireframing">

                        wireframe,  i sticked to the clients colors and made the 
                        sign in page very basic.</p>
