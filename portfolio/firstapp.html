                        <p id="maininfo">
                            This was our final project for UX UI , and we worked 
                            in a group of four to develop a new 
                            social media app for F.I.R.S.T. Institute students. 
                            The goal of this project was to develop the 
                            main pages of the app, without delving too deep into 
                            the deeper individual pages of the site map. We 
                            were to follow F.I.R.S.T.'s brand guidelines to maintain brand consistency.

                                            Our group was responsible for designing 9 pages 
                                            of an app. How we showed these in our designs are 
                                            completely up to us and our group. This can be 
                                            through links, buttons, icons, etc. These where the 
                                            required pages.

                        <h3>Design Process</h3>
                        <p>
                            As a group, we decided that each of us would work on two pages for the app. We agreed to conduct individual research and create wireframe sketches. My responsibility in the design process was to focus on the sign-in page and the home page. Additionally, I researched the overall aesthetic of the app.
                            </p> 
                            <p>

                            To begin my research, I collected images that inspired the layout for both the sign-in and home pages. This helped me iterate on my ideas as I created our low-fidelity wireframes.
                        </p>
                         
                          <p>
                              
                              
                            
                                           
                                            <h3>WireFrames</h3>
                                            <p>
                                                These lo-fi sketches were developed based on our research and served as a solid foundation for creating the mid-level wireframes. The insights gained during the research phase were instrumental in shaping the design direction and ensuring that the wireframes align with user needs and goals.
                                           </p>
                                           <div id="wireframes">

                          <p>

                          We turned our Mid level WireFrames into  our high 
                          fidelity WireFrames, below are the pages i worked on,
                          Sticking to the brand colors and  Low-Fi design.

                        Here are the high-fidelity wireframes created by my group mates. You will notice a consistent layout throughout, as we collaborated and provided feedback to each other as a Scrum team. I contributed to finalizing the layout for the inbox page, and together we chose to create a ninth page for a "Create a Post" feature. We also included a prompt that asks, "Are you sure you want to leave?" if the user attempts to exit without creating a post.

                                We sticked to the neo brutalism loud typography
                                and for buttons,textboxes and other elements we 
                                used sharp contrasts, unpolished design elements, 
                                asymmetry, , and vibrant color

                         <p>
                             We worked with our client's brand 
                             colors. We used at least three of 
                             the colors listed below, and we went 
                             with what our research showed the 
                             school uses the most in its branding 
                             and other school merchandise.

                                            These are the two main colors our

                                            and school merchandise so we went 
                                            with these two as they are the most 
                                            recognized colors the students are 
                                            familiar with when it comes to this 
                                            client, our idea was to keep it 
                                            familiar, so we used it in about 
                                            50% of our color choices.

                                            These are the three accent colors 
                                            that are part of our client's brand, 
                                            we use them in about 30% and 20% of 
                                            our color choices, mostly on things 
                                            like buttons and the sign-in 
                                            background, we are glad about how 
                                            this turned out because we carefully 
                                            used the accent colors without 
                                            overpowering the main colors.

                                    We created our buttons based on the 
                                    neo-brutalism design aesthetic thick and 
                                    colorful, we made small and large buttons, 
                                    all used throughout the design, and we 
                                    maintained this style for all the buttons 
                                    and text boxes.

                                    These are the two main colors our 
                                    client uses mostly in their branding 
                                    and school merchandise so we went 
                                    with these two as they are the most 
                                    recognized colors the students are 
                                    familiar with when it comes to this 
                                    client, our idea was to keep it 
                                    familiar, so we used it in about 
                                    50% of our color choices.

                    This was our final prototype for the student app using 
                    figma,it worked as desired by the client, all nine pages 
                    of the app were protoyed and worked well with each other.
                    Here is a link to our protoype.
