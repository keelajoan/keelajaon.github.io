            <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
                <p>Our group project was to create an Agile App for FIRST institute students to enhance the experience of both prospective and current students through a digital platform.

                <h3>Challenges:</h3>

<p>
    Students were using various fragmented systems for different tasks (schedules, grades, events, etc.), which led to frustration and inefficiency.
    The institution's existing mobile experience was outdated and had limited engagement features.
    The app needed to cater to a wide audience: new students, returning students, and faculty members.
    Objectives
    Streamline access to key information – Provide students with easy access to grades, class schedules, campus events, announcements, and other important features.
    Improve student engagement – Integrate features that enhance student engagement, such as social components, event discovery, and peer interactions.
    Simplify administrative tasks – Allow students to manage course registrations, communicate with professors, and track academic progress.
    Ensure accessibility and inclusivity – Design the app to be accessible for all students, including those with disabilities.
    Modernize the user interface – Create a clean, intuitive, and responsive design that appeals to a younger, tech-savvy audience.
    Research</p>
<h3>Key insights:</h3>
<p>
    Most students preferred a centralized place for grades, schedules, and academic announcements.
    Students wanted to easily discover campus events and student clubs.
    There was a strong desire for push notifications related to class updates, assignments, and deadlines.
    3. Competitor Analysis
    We analyzed apps from similar institutions, such as University of Michigan’s “MGoBlue” app, and other student services apps (like Blackboard and Campuswire) to see what features were successful and which were underutilized. We also examined social media and messaging platforms for inspiration on building student communities.
</p>


<h3>Design Process</h3>
<p>
    1. Personas
    Based on research insights, we created three primary user personas:
    
    Emily, the Freshman: A new student who is still getting used to the college environment. Needs guidance on navigating the app and understanding college procedures.
    Jake, the Senior: An experienced student who wants to efficiently track assignments, manage his schedule, and find opportunities for involvement on campus.
    Professor Singh: A faculty member who needs an efficient way to communicate class updates, grade assignments, and manage course materials.
    2. User Journeys
    We mapped out user journeys for key tasks, such as:
    
    Emily navigating her class schedule for the first time.
    Jake registering for courses and attending virtual office hours.
    Professor Singh posting an announcement and grading assignments.
    3. Wireframing & Prototyping
    We began wireframing key screens based on the user journeys. The core features of the app were grouped into several categories:
    
    Dashboard: A personalized homepage showing upcoming assignments, grades, and campus events.
    Schedule & Grades: A unified space to manage class schedules and track academic progress.
    Campus Life: Information on clubs, events, student news, and social activities.
    Notifications & Alerts: Real-time notifications for assignment deadlines, exam schedules, and campus announcements.
    Communication Tools: In-app messaging system for students and professors, and a bulletin board for general announcements.
    Prototyping: We used Figma to create high-fidelity prototypes and interactive flows. We tested the app internally with small groups of students to gather feedback and refine designs.
    </p>
<h3>4. Usability Testing</h3>
<p>We conducted two rounds of usability testing with a group of 15 students to identify pain points in the navigation, ease of access to critical information, and the intuitiveness of key features. Based on their feedback, we made adjustments:

    Simplified the course registration process by reducing the number of steps.
    Improved the event discovery flow, adding a filter for types of events (e.g., academic, social, sports).
    Made the notifications more customizable, allowing users to set preferences for the types of alerts they receive.
    Key Features
    Dashboard
    
    A quick view of important tasks: grades, schedule, assignments, and upcoming deadlines.
    Personalized recommendations for campus events, clubs, and study resources.
    Course Management
    
    A sleek, simple interface to view schedules, register for courses, and access class materials.
    Notifications for upcoming exams, assignments, and office hours.
    Campus Life Integration
    
    Campus event calendar with RSVP options.
    Directory of student clubs and societies with direct links to join or participate.
    Push notifications for events tailored to the user’s interests (e.g., academic talks, sports games, social meetups).
    Communication Hub
    
    Direct messaging for students to connect with faculty or advisors.
    In-app notifications for announcements and peer discussions.
    Accessibility Features
    
    High contrast mode, text resizing, and screen reader compatibility for better accessibility.
    Language preferences to cater to non-English speaking students.
    Final Design
    The final design reflected a modern, intuitive, and responsive mobile experience with a clear hierarchy of information. It was developed with an emphasis on usability and student engagement. The color scheme was designed to evoke a sense of trust and school spirit, using the institution’s branding.
    </p>
<h3>Results & Impact</h3>
<p>
    the app was successfully launched and met several key goals:

    User Adoption: Within the first month, 80% of new students and 60% of returning students had downloaded and actively used the app.
    Increased Engagement: Campus event attendance increased by 25% among students who used the app.
    Positive Feedback: Students reported greater satisfaction with the ease of finding and accessing academic and campus-related information. Faculty also appreciated the streamlined communication tools.
    Conclusion
    The development of the First Institute College App significantly improved the student experience by centralizing important academic and campus information in one easy-to-use platform. By leveraging user research and continuously iterating on design, we were able to deliver a product that not only met the immediate needs of students but also created a foundation for future improvements and features.
    
    This project demonstrated the importance of user-centered design and the value of ongoing feedback in creating a solution that truly enhances the experience of college life.
</p>

<h3>Reflection:</h3>
<p>Looking back on the project, I feel proud of how we were able to balance the diverse needs of students, faculty, and administrators while creating a product that felt intuitive and fresh. One lesson I learned is the importance of continuously testing assumptions with real users and making data-driven design decisions. Going forward, I would like to explore integrating AI-driven features like personalized academic advice and career counseling for a more holistic student experience.
