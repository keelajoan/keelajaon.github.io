                    Patrice Émery Lumumba[e] (/lʊˈmʊmbə/ ⓘ;[3] 2 July 1925 – 
                    17 January 1961), born Isaïe Tasumbu Tawosa,[4] was a 
                    Congolese politician and independence leader who served as 
                    the first prime minister of the Democratic Republic of the 
                    Congo (then known as the Republic of the Congo) from June 
                    until September 1960, following the May 1960 election. 
                    He was the leader of the Congolese National Movement 
                    (MNC) from 1958 until his assassination in 1961. 
                    Ideologically an African nationalist and pan-Africanist, 
                    he played a significant role in the transformation of the 
                    Congo from a colony of Belgium into an independent republic.
                    Shortly after Congolese independence in June 1960, a mutiny 
                    broke out in the army, marking the beginning of the Congo 
                    Crisis. After a coup, Lumumba attempted to escape to 
                    Stanleyville to join his supporters who had established a 
                    new anti-Mobutu state called the Free Republic of the Congo. 
                    Lumumba was captured en route by state authorities under 
                    Joseph-Désiré Mobutu, sent to the State of Katanga and, 
                    with the help of Belgian partisans, tortured and executed 
                    by the separatist Katangan authorities of Moïse Tshombe. 
                    He was seen as a martyr for the pan-African movement. 
                    In 2002, Belgium formally apologised for its role in the 
                    execution.

                    Photograph of Lumumba, c. 1950s
                    Patrice Lumumba was born on 2 July 1925 as Isaïe Tasumbu 
                    Tawosa to Julienne Wamato Lomendja and her husband, François 
                    Tolenga Otetshima, a farmer, in Onalua, in the Katakokombe 
                    region of the Kasai province of the Belgian Congo.[5][6] 
                    He was a member of the Tetela ethnic group and was born 
                    with the name Élias Okit'Asombo.[7][8][9] His original 
                    surname means "heir of the cursed" and is derived from the 
                    Tetela words okitá/okitɔ́ ('heir', 'successor')[10] and 
                    asombó ('cursed or bewitched people who will die quickly').
                    [11] He had three brothers (Charles Lokolonga, Émile Kalema, 
                    and Louis Onema Pene Lumumba) and one half-brother 
                    (Jean Tolenga).[5] Raised in a Catholic family, he was 
                    educated at a Protestant primary school, a Catholic 
                    missionary school, and finally the government post office 
                    training school, where he passed the one-year course with 
                    distinction. He was known for being a vocal, precocious 
                    young man, regularly pointing out the errors of his teachers 
                    in front of his peers.[12] This outspoken nature would come 
                    to define his life and career. Lumumba spoke Tetela, French, 
                    Lingala, Swahili, and Tshiluba.[5]
                </p>

                    Outside of his regular studies, Lumumba took an interest in 
                    the Enlightenment ideals of Jean-Jacques Rousseau and 
                    Voltaire. He was also fond of Molière and Victor Hugo. 
                    He wrote poetry, and many of his works had anti-imperialist 
                    themes.[13] He worked as a travelling beer salesman in 
                    Léopoldville and as a postal clerk in Stanleyville for 
                    eleven years.[14] Lumumba was married three times. 
                    He married Henriette Maletaua a year after arriving in 
                    Stanleyville; they divorced in 1947. In the same year, 
                    he married Hortense Sombosia, but this relationship also 
                    fell apart. He began an affair with Pauline Kie. While he 
                    had no children with his first two wives, his relationship 
                    with Kie resulted in a son, François Lumumba. Though he 
                    remained close with Kie until his death, Lumumba ultimately 
                    ended their affair to marry Pauline Opangu in 1951.[1]

                    After his release, Lumumba helped found the Mouvement 
                    National Congolais (MNC) party in 1958 and quickly became 
                    the organisation's leader.[13] The MNC, unlike other 
                    Congolese parties developing at the time, did not draw on a 
                    particular ethnic base.[18] It promoted a platform that 
                    included independence, gradual Africanisation of the 
                    government, state-led economic development, and neutrality 
                    in foreign affairs. Lumumba had a large popular 
                    following[18] and as a result, he had more political 
                    autonomy than contemporaries who were more dependent on 
                    Belgian connections.[19]

                    The conference culminated on 27 January 1960 with a 
                    declaration of Congolese independence. It set 30 June 1960 
                    as the independence date with national elections to be held 
                    from 11 to 25 May 1960. The MNC won a plurality in the 
                    election. Six weeks before the date of independence, 
                    Walter Ganshof van der Meersch was appointed as the 
                    Belgian Minister of African Affairs. He lived in 
                    Léopoldville, in effect becoming Belgium's de facto 
                    resident minister in the Congo, administering it jointly 
                    with Governor-general Hendrik Cornelis.[21] He was charged 
                    with advising King Baudouin on the selection of a formateur.
                    [22] On 8 June 1960, Ganshof flew to Brussels to meet with 
                    Baudouin. He made three suggestions for formateur: Lumumba, 
                    as the winner of the elections; Joseph Kasa-Vubu, the only 
                    figure with a reliable national reputation who was 
                    associated with the coalescing opposition; or some to-be-
                    determined third individual who could unite the competing 
                    blocs.[23]

                    Lumumba did not espouse a comprehensive political or 
                    economic platform.[199] According to Patricia Goff, 
                    Lumumba was the first Congolese to articulate a narrative 
                    of the Congo that contradicted traditional Belgian views 
                    of colonisation, and he highlighted the suffering of the 
                    indigenous population under European rule. Goff writes that 
                    Lumumba was alone among his contemporaries in encompassing 
                    all Congolese people in his narrative (the others confined 
                    their discussions to their respective ethnicities or 
                    regions),[200] and he offered a basis for national identity 
                    that was predicated upon having survived colonial 
                    victimisation, as well as the people's innate dignity, 
                    humanity, strength, and unity.[201]
