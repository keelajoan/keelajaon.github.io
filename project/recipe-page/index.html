                This Avocado Quinoa Salad is a spot-on copycat of my all-time 
                favorite from Mendocino Farms, where I actually used to work. 
                It's loaded with crispy quinoa, fresh veggies, and a zesty 
                chipotle vinaigrette that's just irresistible. I loved it so
                much,I had to recreate it at home – and now you can too!
